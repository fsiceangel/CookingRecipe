      "Authentic carbonara does not use cream; the creaminess comes from the egg, cheese, and pasta water.",
      "It is crucial to let the pan cool slightly before adding the eggs to prevent them from scrambling.",
      "Using freshly grated cheese and freshly ground black pepper is highly recommended for the best flavor and texture."

      "First, prepare the ingredients. Add the sugar and yeast to the warm water to activate the yeast. Sugar helps activate the yeast, but you can omit it and simply extend the proofing time. Stir until the sugar dissolves, then pour it into the flour along with the oil and milk.",
      "Transfer the dough to a work surface. Knead with the heel of your hand, pushing in one direction. Stop immediately once the dough is smooth (over-kneading will warm the dough, causing it to bubble and become rough). Kneading for about 15 minutes should be sufficient.",
      "Shape the dough into a ball and let it rest for 5 minutes.",
      "Sprinkle a little flour on the work surface. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out, leaving a small border at the top and bottom. Then, turn it horizontally and continue rolling to form a rectangular shape.",
      "Once rolled out, brush the surface evenly with a little water. Press one edge thin with your fingers, then start rolling tightly from the opposite edge, shaping it as you go to maintain a consistent width.",
      "Gently roll the dough from the center outwards to form a long, even log about 3 cm in diameter. Cut it into pieces about two fingers wide.",
      "Place the dough pieces loosely in a steamer, leaving space between them as they will expand. Cover and let them proof at room temperature until they are 1.5 times their original size.",
      "To check if the dough is ready, gently press it with your fingertip. It should bounce back slowly. If it doesn't bounce back, it's over-proofed. A cross-section should show small, uniform air pockets.",
      "Once the water in the steamer is boiling, place the steamer basket inside and steam over high heat for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, turn off the heat. You can open the lid and serve them immediately."
